# Upanshu Parekh's LeetCode Solutions
My leetcode solutions, updated as I do them (mostly in Python). My thought processes, notes, and  problem-solving can be found in each problem's comments. I usually analyze where I went wrong, what I did right, any major breakthroughs (like solving hard problems within 40 minsðŸ˜„), general reactions and a comparison to other solutions.

My language of choice was Python because it abstracts away the lower level details that are inherent to some other languages, and helps me focus on the algorithm design rather than the aforementioned small details.

The first 150 problems I am going to do are from [NeetCode](https://github.com/neetcode-gh)'s 150 List.
They are done in the order of the completion tree from their [Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) website.

![NeetCode's LeetCode Tree](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/846943881411952651/1118692324881481768/NC_Category_Tree.png)

This is why you'll find a `Depth` tag before the names of some the folders.

The folders themselves are named according to the type of algorithmic techniques used in the folder's LeetCode problems.

So the folder labeled *"Depth 2. Stacks"* corresponds to the second level of the NC tree above, and in that folder there are LeetCode problems that are solved via the stack data structure.
