# Upanshu Parekh's LeetCode Solutions
My leetcode solutions, updated as I do them. My thought processes, notes, and 
problem-solving can be found in each problem's comments. I usually analyze 
where I went wrong, what I did right, any major breakthroughs (like solving 
hard problems within 40 minsðŸ˜„), general reactions and a comparison to other 
solutions.

## Language of Choice

My language of choice was Python **initially** because it abstracts away the 
lower level details that are inherent to some other languages, and helps me 
focus on the algorithm design rather than the aforementioned small details.

I then changed my language of choice to C++ because in my experience with
internship applications, especially for some trading companies/quants, some
coding exams restrict you to using only C/C++. Besides, it's also a bit more
of a flex to do it in C++, on top of having more control over how I want to
go about implementing something.

The solutions are divided into a C++ and Python folder because I may revisit
my Python problems and redo them in C++ at a later date. 

### When solving these problems, I kept these rules in mind:
- Spend no more than 30 minutes on Easy problems, no more than 45 minutes on 
Medium problems, and no more than 1 hour on Hard problems. Once that threshold 
was crossed, unless I could feel the solution was in sight, I stopped right 
there and began to try to understand the solution. This prevents me from 
banging my head against the wall ðŸ™ƒ, and helps me actually learn a way to solve 
the problem I would not have figured out on my own.

- I spent the 15 minutes after I either completed the problem, or failed at it, 
to see the video solutions provided by NeetCode, or other code solutions, to 
understand other perspectives on solving the problems. These are noted down as 
well.

The first 150 problems I am going to do are from 
[NeetCode](https://github.com/neetcode-gh)'s 150 List.
They are done in the order of the completion tree from their 
[Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) website.

![NeetCode's LeetCode Tree](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/846943881411952651/1118692324881481768/NC_Category_Tree.png)

This is why you'll find a `Depth` tag before the names of some the folders.

The folders themselves are named according to the type of algorithmic 
techniques used in the folder's LeetCode problems.

So the folder labeled *"Depth 2. Stacks"* corresponds to the second level of 
the NC tree above, and in that folder there are LeetCode problems that are 
solved via the stack data structure.
